      Are you struggling with negative feelings such as anxiety and depression?
      Or perhaps one of your children is acting out and you need help with how
      to cope as a parent? I can help with providing assessment and counselling
      to help put your life back on track. I help adults, children, teens, and
      their families cope with various challenges, such as separation/divorce,
      grief/loss, trauma, parent-child conflict, parenting, anxiety, depression,
      and communication.
